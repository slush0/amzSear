<a name="installation"></a>
### Installation

Can easily be be run on Python version 3 or greater with minimal additional dependencies.

Install the dependencies and main package using pip.

```
$ pip install amzsear
```

For those wanting to upgrade to version 2, use the command:

```
$ pip install amzsear --upgrade
```

Note: The [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) package is not a required dependency for amzSear, however a few methods do use it (see [AmzSear.md](docs/core/AmzSear.md#to_dataframe), [AmzBase.md](docs/core/AmzBase.md#to_series)) if one wants to integrate with Pandas. If this is the case, pandas should be installed separately using:
```
$ pip install pandas
```

<a name="usage"></a>
### Usage

AmzSear can be used in two ways, from the command line and as a Python package.

#### CLI
The amzSear CLI allows Amazon search queries to be performed directly from the command line. In it's simplest form, the CLI only requires a query.

```
$ amzsear 'Harry Potter Books'
```

However, additional options can be set to select the page number, item, region or the output format. For example:

```
$ amzsear 'Harry Potter' -p 2 -i B00728DYLA --output json
```

The above query will display the item with ASIN B00728DYLA on page 2 as a JSON object. The `-i` flag accepts both ASIN and numeric index (0-based position).

#### Product Lookup by ASIN

You can also fetch detailed product information directly by ASIN using the `-P/--product` flag:

```
$ amzsear -P B00006IFHD
```

```
ASIN:   B00006IFHD
Title:  Sharpie Permanent Markers Set Quick Drying And Fade Resistant Fine ...
Brand:  Sharpie
Rating: 4.8/5 (43,116 reviews)

About this item (7 points):
  1. Fine-tipped, Detailed Marks: Versatile fine tip allows users to make eye-catchin...
  2. Permanent Ink: Makes a resilient mark on paper, plastic, and metal surfaces
  3. Quick-Drying: Quick-drying feature ensures writing resilience against water and ...
  ... and 4 more

Technical details (21 fields)
```

This fetches the product page and extracts detailed information including brand, full title, bullet points, technical specifications, and review statistics. All output formats (short, verbose, json, csv) are supported.

Use `-b/--browser` to open the product page in your default browser:

```
$ amzsear -P B00006IFHD -b
```

For more examples and for extended usage information see the [CLI Readme](docs/cli/README.md).


#### API

```python
from amzsear import AmzSear
amz = AmzSear('Harry Potter')
```

In the latest version of amzSear dedicated `AmzSear` and `AmzProduct` classes have been created to allow easier extraction of Amazon product information in a Python program. For example:
```python
>>> from amzsear import AmzSear
>>> amz = AmzSear('Harry Potter', page=2, region='CA')
>>> 
>>> last_item = amz.rget(-1) # retrieves the last item in the amzSear
>>> print(last_item)
title               "[Sponsored]Kids' Travel Guide - London: The fun way to discover Lo..."
product_url         'https://www.amazon.com/gp/slredirect/picassoRedirect.html/ref=pa_s...'
image_url           'https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61CatLnbhQL._AC_U...'
rating              ratings_text          '4.6 out of 5 stars'
                    ratings_count_text    '29'
                    <Valid AmzRating object>
prices              {'Perfect Paperback': '$8.37', '1': '$10.90'}
extra_attributes    {}
subtext             ['by Sarah-Jane Williams and FlyingKids']
<Valid AmzProduct object>
>>> 
>>> print(last_item.get_prices()) # retrieves all price values as floats
[8.37, 10.9]
```
